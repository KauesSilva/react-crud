## üìï Why/How it was built

The system developed is a CRUD built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It was used yarn as a package manager and Vite as a build tool. The idea for the project came to me as a continuation of the [weather-app](https://github.com/KauesSilva/weather-app) project, where I only used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Due to being a front-end project, the entire project consists in sharing between components the user's informations that were stored in an array of objects for a future manipulation.

The project lasted around for two weeks, and throughout the development process, I learned a lot about React, including Hooks, componentization, web packs, typing in React components, and absolute imports, among others, and I believe that it was one more important step in my career as a developer.
